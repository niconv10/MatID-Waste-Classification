# 🌴 1. Problem & Motivation

### The Florida Context: Beauty & Boom
To understand the waste problem, we must look at where it comes from. Florida is defined by two massive forces:

1.  **The Standard of Beauty (Maintenance):** In Florida, keeping the state green and clean is a daily obsession. Manicured golf courses, neighborhoods, and highways generate millions of tons of **Yard Waste** annually.
2.  **The Construction Explosion (Development):** Florida state is defined by growth. Every new condo, outlet mall, and high-rise creates massive amounts of **Construction & Demolition (C&D)** debris.

> **The Result:** Landscape maintenance and rapid city development generate millions of tons of waste per year. **This is where the problem begins.**
